Todo:
1. Add review code ( look at car_reservation/templates/car_search.html , and for rating I'm using car_reservation/templates/rating_page.html )
2. Disable the days before today in the date calender form
3. Add the pagination using the Paginator ( look at my code at car_reservation/views.py/ -->  search view )
4. Add filtering by rating and price ( see my car_reservation/templates/car_search.html scripts and search view )

for me : 
1. Add in the tasks email sending for attraciotns
2. Add email sending when payment is successfully
